This method detects behavioural changes (caused by hooks) on sleep calls by forcing a race condition. Here are a pseudo-code on how it works: 

 - sleep(n)
 - creates mutex "12345"
 - terminates if mutex "12345" exists
 
 - if running version is inside persisted directory
     - deletes original binary
     - computes main payload
     - delete mutex "12345"
     - terminates
 - else
     - persists itself in %APPDATA%
     - executes persisted binary
     - do some computation (just to cover the time taken for setup persisted version);
     - sleep(n/2)
     - terminates

The outcome is that the main payload is not executed if sleep is shortcutted by hooks. This technique is implemented by default in many sandboxes in order to avoid malware delaying its own execution.
