This method detects behavioural changes (caused by hooks) on sleep calls by forcing a race condition. Here are a pseudo-code on how it works: 

 - sleep(n)
 - persists itself in %APPDATA%
 - terminates if mutex "12345" exists
 - creates mutex "12345"
 - executes persisted binary
 - if running version is inside persisted directory
     - computes main payload;
     - delete mutex "12345";
     - terminates
 - else
     - delete itself
     - sleep(n/2)
     - deletes mutex "12345";
     - terminates

The outcome is that the main payload is not executed if sleep is shortcutted by hooks. This technique is implemented by default in many sandboxes in order to avoid malware delaying its own execution.
